# Machine Learning Grain Moisture Sensor Calibration



The objective of this study was to investigate the inaccuracy of a capacitance
moisture sensors mounted on a combine harvester machine as well as to calibrate these sensor readings with the help of different machine learning algorithms, according to reference moisture measurements obtained by mobile moisture sensor.

On the basis of conducted experiments and evidence obtained from literature review, this study demonstrates that machine learning can be used for the purposes of calibration. This research showed that all deployed machine learning models were able to significantly improve the readings of the combine harvester sensor where the best performing models obtained $R^2$ of 0.88, RMSE of 0.35 and MAE of 0.24 scores.
Furthermore this study highlights the reasons for diverging measurements and importance of data collection process in enhancing further performance of these models.
